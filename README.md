Some scripts and functions to read and analyse OpenFOAM simulation results.

## ToDo:

 - Comments!
 - Joint QR histograms
 - Enstrophy histograms for the liquid and gas phases.
 - Measure the rotational energy
 - A compiled version of the above that can run in most supercomputers
   as efficiently as possible.
